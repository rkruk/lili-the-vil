<p><a href="https://aiyprojects.withgoogle.com/voice/" target="_blank">The AIY Voice Kit from Google</a> cardboard box seems 
kind of cheap for that precious little device. As I had a dusty leftover Halloween plastic skull lying around it seems pretty 
obvious to me that it should be used for this little project.</p>

<p>Straight from the box the AIY Voice Kit itself looks nice, but I don't believe it was created to last long. The cartoon box doesn't look solid enough for me.</p>

<p>At first I wanted to change the button I received with the kit to different color. But around that time I had a chance to watch firtst Terminator movie... and... you know... somehow the blue button began to be a centre of this project :D .</p>

<p>The skull had been cut open with a help of a dremmel tool, and 'activation button' was fitted into eye socket (where else? :) ).</p>
