<p>Lili The Vil is a mini Voice Recognition project I'm working on when I have a spare time (which means RARELY).<br>
It is mostly based on Google Voice Recognition Addon to Raspberry Pi https://aiyprojects.withgoogle.com/voice/.</p>
<br><br>
<p><b>At this moment this project is stale</b> as I'm trying to figure it out how to randomise and anonymise requests sended to google servers from this little device. I also started to think about other options to try as for example  different VoiceRecognition providers. The Personal Assistant On my desk seams like a nice idea. But... when I think about sending voice commands or even letting to manage my microphone by Google or Amazon... Uh well it is creepy at least... Isn't it?<br> 
That is why this little project exist. As there is no viable open source options with good voice recognition patterns, databases, etc..<br>
  There a few things here to work with:<br>
- I would like to try work around the key binding to the single Google/Amazon account here to randomize output send to external servers. Is it even possible?<br>
- To work on a 'Press Button' command only solution. I don't like the idea of microphone turn on 24h/7days a week, no matter if it's sending data out or not.
