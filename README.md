<p>Lili The Vil is a mini Voice Recognition project I'm working on when I have a spare time (which means RARELY).<br>
It is mostly based on Google Voice Recognition Addon to Raspberry Pi https://aiyprojects.withgoogle.com/voice/.</p>

<p><b>At this moment this project is stale</b> as I'm trying to figure it out how to randomise and anonymise requests sended to google servers from this little device.</p><br>
<p>I also started to think about other options to try here - as for example different VoiceRecognition providers, change default host OS.</p><br>
<p>At first the Personal Assistant On my desk seamed like a nice idea... BUT... when I started to think about it sending all voice commands outside. Or even letting to manage my microphone by Google/Amazon/... Uh well it creep me out a bit to be honest. If you think about it you began to wonder what kind of creep wants to collect that sort of data.<br> 
That is why this little project exist on the paper so far. As there is no viable open source options with good voice recognition patterns, databases, security models, local data retention, etc..<br><br>
There a few things here to work with:<br>
- If go with awailable software (the commercial one) I would like to try work around the key binding to the single Google/Amazon account here to randomize output send to external servers. Is it even possible? Will it get banned? Is it against licences?<br>
- Research and try Open Source available projects. Review their security model, data retention, where the data is stored (locally preferable), Voice PAtern Recognition Software is base on what exactly in those projects?
- To work on a 'Press Button to Voice Command' only solution. I don't like the idea of microphone turn on 24h/7days a week, no matter if it's sending data out or not.
